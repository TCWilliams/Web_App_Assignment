This was a group (size 2) assignment that went wrong. The idea was that I would provide the server side and my partner would work on client side.

It turned out that my partner didn't want to do the assignment. We had discussed that he would make a UI and do button event handling. 
That didn't pan out so to make submission I made a last minute mock UI and event handling to display that my server code was working.

Files that I worked on and was pleased with:
	App_Code - Item.cs, Server.cs

Files I made in a hurry
	ServerDemoPage.aspx.cs
	Login.aspx.cs
